        <p><i>"Know what you own and why you own it."</i> In that spirit, here are a few thoughts on the top holdings:</p>
        <p><b>Frasers Commercial Trust (US$1.1bn) and Frasers Logistics & Industrial Trust (US$2.1bn): </b>Agreed to merge recently, creating a US$3bn behemoth. Larger REITs tend to enjoy lower funding costs, so this creates more firepower for acquisitions. FCOT used to be the most conservatively managed Singapore-focused office property trust, but has since become a bit more diversified. By NAV, it’s roughly 55% Singapore, 38% Australia and 7% UK; by income the split is 41%/50%/9%. There’s some potential for upward rental reversions from China Square Central as the leases expire and the area’s redevelopment continues. Pretty fairly valued at 1.05x P/B with a 5.9% dividend yield. FLT owns 81 warehouses in Australia and Europe. Pretty strong operational metrics, but hit by FX weakness. DPU is growing 4% in AUD terms, but shrinking 3% in SGD terms.</p>
        <p><b>Microsoft (US$1.26tn): </b>Man, it feels weird typing in that market cap. And yet, it seems like the total addressable market (TAM) for cloud services has been completely underestimated. Azure grew +59% yoy in the last quarter off a huge base. Some crazy yoy numbers: revenue +14%, operating income +27%, and these numbers included a drag from FX translations. I think Microsoft is a lock to compound earnings at 15-20% over the next few years, and on track to return something like US$32bn each year to shareholders via buybacks and dividends. A much transformed company under stellar leadership, and now firing on all cylinders. Should probably be a larger holding, to be honest.</p>
        <p><b>Elite Commercial REIT (US$330mn mkt cap): </b>A pretty small-cap REIT listed in Singapore holding 97 properties across the UK, 99% leased to the UK government. The bulk of the properties are located in city centres and triple-net leased to the UK Department of Work and Pensions, i.e. the unemployment and welfare department, with a weighted average lease of 8.6 years. Trades at 1.1x P/B, with a dividend yield of 6.6%. Pretty sturdy, just not a ton of upside in terms of rental reversions, but some potential acquisitions in the UK if it trades well. Exposed to sterling, which could be a good or bad thing, depending on how you look at it (I don't have a particularly strong view). Overall, this should be a pretty stable holding.</p>
        <p><b>Amazon (US$906bn): </b>Amazon is no longer the no-brainer that it was at $360, but I reckon AWS could be worth US$500bn, and the retail side accounts for the rest of the valuation. Seeing some competition from the likes of Shopify, as the Internet space fragments into tribes, but continues to take share from the offline retailers. If this were a Chinese company, could spin some dog-and-pony story and get phantom valuation for its health and logistics arms. Ultimately, with a company this side, you are making an investment in management and company culture. It sounds weird to say this, but Amazon is no longer aggressively overvalued. By my reckoning, it trades at 25x FY22f P/E, if you normalize earnings. Clearly, they're going to undeclare earnings to reduce their tax liability, but this is a company that could declare mammoth profits whenever it wants to.</p>
