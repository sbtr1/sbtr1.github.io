        <p><i>"Know what you own and why you own it."</i> In that spirit, here are a few thoughts on the top holdings:</p>
        <p><b>AEM Holdings (US$375mn): </b>Supplies automated testers and MEMS testers to Intel. PE investor Novo Tellus has a strong track record of getting the right people in to run businesses. Revenue growth continues at about 18% CAGR, with some margin decline from the production ramp. About 33% capacity expansion, which indicates a highly secure customer order (they opened a new floor on their factory for the first time ever). About 25% upside from here if things continue to break right. Trades at 11.1x P/E, with a 2% dividend yield. And yet - why can't it trade at 13-15x like most semiconductor-related companies do? Why not 17x? This is before accounting for any earnings expansion.</p>
        <p><b>Teekay Tankers (US$772mn): </b>A fairly newish position, predicated on a spike in tanker, and supply disruption due to the IMO 2020 regulations. Shipping has been in a 10-year bear market now, and stocks have already moved anywhere from 50–100% year to date, but they could explode upwards due to the highly leveraged nature of the industry. Shippers mostly have high fixed costs, so any small increase in day charter rates fall directly to the bottom line. Long lead time - it takes 2-3 years to deliver a ship - so supply is terribly constrained for now. Teekay only has one VLCC, but specializes in the Aframax and Suezmax sectors (mid-sized tankers). Teekay Tankers trades at 0.8x P/B, so there’s still considerable upside, despite us being somewhat late to the rally. In terms of valuation, if rates persist, TNK should conservatively do about 45% FCF yield this year (not a typo). About $2bn EV, so about 5x EV/EBITDA, and could retire all debt in two years. If trends continue, 2–3x type of returns are in play here. </p>
        <p><b>AIMS Apac REIT (US$750mn): </b>A Singapore-focused industrial REIT. Although it’s ex-growth, it’s among the cheapest of its peers at 1.1x P/B and 7.0% dividend yield. I see some opportunity for rental uplift from conversion of industrial space to other uses (e.g. lifestyle activities). Not much to say here, should be happy if the share price goes nowhere while picking a 7% dividend.</p>
        <p><b>Frasers Commercial Trust (US$1.1bn) and Frasers Logistics & Industrial Trust (US$2.1bn): </b>Agreed to merge recently, creating a US$3bn behemoth. Larger REITs tend to enjoy lower funding costs, so this creates more firepower for acquisitions. FCOT used to be the most conservatively managed Singapore-focused office property trust, but has since become a bit more diversified. By NAV, it’s roughly 55% Singapore, 38% Australia and 7% UK; by income the split is 41%/50%/9%. There’s some potential for upward rental reversions from China Square Central as the leases expire and the area’s redevelopment continues. Pretty fairly valued at 1.05x P/B with a 5.9% dividend yield. FLT owns 81 warehouses in Australia and Europe. Pretty strong operational metrics, but hit by FX weakness. DPU is growing 4% in AUD terms, but shrinking 3% in SGD terms.</p>
        <p><b>Mega First Corp Bhd (US$520mn): </b>Malaysian construction company with ties to IJM that has completed construction on hydroelectric power plant in Laos. Fee income will start flowing in January (although the river water won't). This is a bit of a "bet on the jockey" play, with an impressive CEO with considerable operating experience. At least 25-33% returns at stake here as Don Sahong revenues come on stream. We are looking at a potential tripling of earnings from 2019 to 2020, with a highly sustainable 6% dividend yield to follow. CEO Goh Nan Kioh was previously with IJM, Dominant Semiconductor and once had a 50% stake in Cambrew, the brewers of Angkor Beer, the most popular beer in Cambodia. This dam could be his swansong, and he's likely to want to manage it well.</p>
        <p><b>CapitaRetail China Trust (US$1.5bn): </b>A China-focused retail REIT, trading at 1.0x P/B with a 6.3% dividend yield. Really the only REITs worth owning are the ones by Mapletree, Capitaland and Frasers.</p>
        <p><b>AerCap Holdings (US$8.1bn): </b>A capital allocation play, AerCap is the world’s largest independent aircraft leaser, after the 2013 acquisition of ILFC from AIG. It owns and manages 1,040 aircraft, compared to GE Capital’s 1,300. AerCap remains larger by revenue as it has a higher quality portfolio of aircraft and clients. The industry continues to grow — with 40% of the aircraft market now on rental, compared to 20% a decade ago. Valuation undemanding — 7.1x P/E, and 0.9x P/B. Low valuation a result of investor perception of a volatile aviation industry (true, but this mostly hits airlines). AerCap locks in leases, with a WALE of 7 years. Key risk is credit profile of its customers, but AerCap benefits from higher-quality blue-chip customer base. In an industry downturn, expect budget airlines to go bust, and AerCap could even benefit by picking off competitors. Management are strong capital allocators, and continue to buy back shares. Probably looking at ~12-15% CAGR returns here for not much work. A much smaller and worse-run competitor, Aircastle, was recently taken private by Marubeni at 1.2x P/B, and AerCap should trade higher than that. The kicker here is if the company is acquired by a larger conglomerate with low funding costs, to start juicing spreads. </p>
        <p><b>ACM Research (US$300mn): </b>Supplier of wafer-cleaning equipment to the DRAM industry. Largest customers are SK Hynix and an undisclosed Chinese DRAM maker (I think Changxin Memory Technologies, or CXMT). Given the Chinese government's intention to build out its own memory industry, expect a bonanza of capex in this space. Revenues were basically flat from 2015 to 2017, then doubled in 2018, and grew another 40% in 2019, with earnings tripling. We've seen this story play out many times in the semiconductor space - where a niche player gains a toe-hold, delivers a quality product, then expands its footprint within its customer base. Pretty soon, it becomes industry standard. Best of all in the semi equipment space - most of the costs are R&D expense to engineers, so sales growth drops to bottom line and ROIC can potentially explode. Reminds me of Lam Research in the early innings. Very strong management quality, including ex-TSMC CTO on board and several ex-Intel executives. CEO David H. Wang is totally committed to the company, having founded it in 1998 and toiling away in obscurity for 20+ years. 18x P/E, but earnings could surprise to the upside. This investment ticks so many boxes that my instinctive reaction was to be highly skeptical: (1) bet on the jockey; (2) undiscovered small cap; (3) growth; (4) quality; (5) valuation; (6) structural trend. If they get to US$50mn in net income, will be a billion-dollar stock.</p>
        <p><b>Vanguard Total Market Index ETF: </b>I have a lot of thoughts on the merits of holding a total market index as a cash proxy instead of cash... it's a lengthy subject that's worth a more in-depth discussion some other time.</p>
