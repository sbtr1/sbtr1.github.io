        <p>In my view, the only real purpose of an investor letter is to detail what you own and why you own it. In that spirit, here are a few thoughts on the top holdings:</p>
        <p><b>AEM Holdings (US$375mn): </b>Supplies automated testers and MEMS testers to Intel. PE investor Novo Tellus has a strong track record of getting the right people in to run businesses. Trades at 11.1x P/E, with a 2% dividend yield. Revenue growth continues at about 18% CAGR, with some margin decline from the production ramp. About 33% capacity expansion, which indicates a highly secure customer order (they opened the second floor of their factory for the first time ever). About 25% upside from here if things continue to break right.</p>
        <p><b>Teekay Tankers (US$772mn): </b>The newest position, based on a spike in VLCC rates, and supply disruption due to the IMO 2020 regulations. Shipping has been in a 10-year bear market now, and stocks have already moved anywhere from 50–100% year to date, but they could explode upwards due to the highly leveraged nature of the industry. Shippers mostly have high fixed costs, so any small increase in day charter rates fall directly to the bottom line. Long lead time - it takes 2-3 years to deliver a ship - so supply is terribly constrained for now. Teekay Tankers trades at 0.8x P/B, so there’s still considerable upside, despite us being somewhat late to the rally. As an indication of market environment, TNK will do north of US$100mn of FCF next quarter at these rates, but it typically does US$100mn of FCF in a year. About $2bn EV, so about 5x EV/EBITDA, and could retire all debt in two years. If trends continue, 2–3x type of returns are in play here.</p>
        <p><b>AIMS Apac REIT (US$750mn): </b>A Singapore-focused industrial REIT. Although it’s ex-growth, it’s among the cheapest of its peers at 1.1x P/B and 7.0% dividend yield. I see some opportunity for rental uplift from conversion of industrial space to other uses (e.g. lifestyle activities). Not much to say here, should be happy if the share price goes nowhere while picking a 7% dividend.</p>
        <p><b>Frasers Commercial Trust (US$1.1bn) and Frasers Logistics & Industrial Trust (US$2.1bn): </b>Agreed to merge recently, creating a US$3bn behemoth. Larger REITs tend to enjoy lower funding costs, so this creates more firepower for acquisitions. FCOT used to be the most conservatively managed Singapore-focused office property trust, but has since become a bit more diversified. By NAV, it’s roughly 55% Singapore, 38% Australia and 7% UK; by income the split is 41%/50%/9%. There’s some potential for upward rental reversions from China Square Central as the leases expire and the area’s redevelopment continues. Pretty fairly valued at 1.05x P/B with a 5.9% dividend yield. FLT owns 81 warehouses in Australia and Europe. Pretty strong operational metrics, but hit by FX weakness. DPU is growing 4% in AUD terms, but shrinking 3% in SGD terms.</p>
        <p><b>Mega First Corp Bhd (US$520mn): </b>Malaysian construction company with ties to IJM that has completed construction on hydroelectric power plant in Laos. Fee income will start flowing in January (although the river water won't). This is a bit of a "bet on the jockey" play, with an impressive CEO with considerable operating experience. At least 25-33% returns at stake here as Don Sahong revenues come on stream. </p>
        <p><b>EC World REIT (US$425mn): </b>A China-focused REIT that focuses on warehouses for e-commerce. Tenant is basically related to sponsor, so this is a way of getting cheap-ish financing for them. Pretty inexpensive and under-levered: 0.9x P/B, 8.4% dividend, 29% gearing ratio, so some room for acquisitions. A little too small, esoteric and off-the-radar for most investors. 90% of leases roll off in 2020, but given the relationship with the sponsor, it’d be nuts not to renew. It’s hard to see how this takes off unless they sell themselves, but I’m happy picking up 8.4% dividend yield for now.</p>
        <p><b>AerCap Holdings (US$8.1bn): </b>A capital allocation play, AerCap is the world’s largest independent aircraft leaser, after the 2013 acquisition of ILFC from AIG. It owns and manages 1,040 aircraft, compared to GE Capital’s 1,300. AerCap remains larger by revenue as it has a higher quality portfolio of aircraft and clients. The industry continues to grow — with 40% of the aircraft market now on rental, compared to 20% a decade ago. Valuation undemanding — 7.1x P/E, and 0.9x P/B. Low valuation a result of investor perception of a volatile aviation industry (true, but this mostly hits airlines). AerCap locks in leases, with a WALE of 7 years. Key risk is credit profile of its customers, but AerCap benefits from higher-quality blue-chip customer base. In an industry downturn, expect budget airlines to go bust, and AerCap could even benefit by picking off competitors. Management are strong capital allocators, and continue to buy back shares. Probably looking at ~12-15% CAGR returns here for not much work. A much smaller and worse-run competitor, Aircastle, was recently taken private by Marubeni at 1.2x P/B, and AerCap should trade higher than that. The kicker here is if the company is acquired by a larger conglomerate with low funding costs, to start juicing spreads. </p>
        <p><b>ACM Research (US$300mn): </b>Supplier of wafer-cleaning equipment to the DRAM industry. Largest customers are SK Hynix and an undisclosed Chinese DRAM maker. Given the Chinese government's intention to build out its own memory industry, expect a bonanza of capex in this space. Grew revenues 40% in 2019 and earnings a little better. Reminds me of Lam Research in the early innings. 18x P/E, but earnings could surprise to the upside. If they get to US$50mn in net income, this will be a billion-dollar stock.</p>
        <p><b>Blackstone (US$66.0bn): </b>A little pricier than the other alternative asset managers, but the entire sector continues to see extremely strong inflows. AUM up 24% yoy, and that drives fee-related revenue (other revenue items can be a bit lumpy due to timing of deal completion). Management continues to do share buybacks, on top of paying out a 4.5% dividend. Lots of dry powder, at US$150bn of US$545bn AUM, which will only start generating fees when deployed. Low rates seem here to stay, which benefits all kinds of alternative asset managers in the hunt for yield. A “set-it-and-forget-it” kind of investment.</p>
