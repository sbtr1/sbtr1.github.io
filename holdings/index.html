        <p><i>"Know what you own and why you own it."</i> In that spirit, here are a few thoughts on the top holdings:</p>
        <p><b>AEM Holdings (US$400mn): </b>Supplies automated testers and MEMS testers to Intel. PE investor Novo Tellus has a strong track record of getting the right people in to run businesses. Revenue growth continues at about 18% CAGR, with some margin decline from the production ramp. About 33% capacity expansion, which indicates a highly secure customer order (they opened a new floor on their factory for the first time ever). Trades at 11.1x P/E, with a 2% dividend yield. And yet - why can't it trade at 13-15x like most semiconductor-related companies do? Why not 17x? This is before accounting for any earnings expansion. Recently guided for S$330-350mn in revenue next year. Let's do some quick math - assume they maintain a 15% net margin, that gets them to S$52mn of earnings. Now apply a 13x P/E multiple, and that gets you to S$680mn in market cap, versus a current market cap of S$550mn, leaving about 20% of upside this year. Granted, it's a simplistic analysis, but some of the best investment theses are the simplest ones. </p>
        <p><b>AIMS APAC REIT (US$750mn): </b>A Singapore-focused industrial REIT. Although it’s ex-growth, it’s among the cheapest of its peers at 1.1x P/B and 7.0% dividend yield. I see some opportunity for rental uplift from conversion of industrial space to other uses (e.g. lifestyle activities). Not much to say here, should be happy if the share price goes nowhere while picking a 7% dividend.</p>
        <p><b>Frasers Commercial Trust (US$1.1bn) and Frasers Logistics & Industrial Trust (US$2.1bn): </b>Agreed to merge recently, creating a US$3bn behemoth. Larger REITs tend to enjoy lower funding costs, so this creates more firepower for acquisitions. FCOT used to be the most conservatively managed Singapore-focused office property trust, but has since become a bit more diversified. By NAV, it’s roughly 55% Singapore, 38% Australia and 7% UK; by income the split is 41%/50%/9%. There’s some potential for upward rental reversions from China Square Central as the leases expire and the area’s redevelopment continues. Pretty fairly valued at 1.05x P/B with a 5.9% dividend yield. FLT owns 81 warehouses in Australia and Europe. Pretty strong operational metrics, but hit by FX weakness. DPU is growing 4% in AUD terms, but shrinking 3% in SGD terms.</p>
        <p><b>Square (US$32bn): </b>Super strong metrics across the board from Square: payment volumes up to US$28.2bn in the quarter, +25% yoy, and adjusted net revenues +40% yoy, with adjusted EBITDA registering +85% yoy growth. Starting from merchants, Square is building out an entire ecosystem that allows cash to remain within its walled garden, allowing merchants to process payroll with its processing tools. The Square Cash App has been an unmitigated success, and collecting fees on bitcoin trading allows for more upside. Payments are the ultimate examples of scalability: build a strong infrastructure, and collect toll fees that rise with payment volumes. I see this as a potential US$100bn stock by the end of the decade, although it might be a bumpy road. Management is a little distracted (Jack Dorsey is currently on sabbatical in Africa), but at least it's put in place the right people to succeed. </p>
        <p><b>Microsoft (US$1.26tn): </b>Man, it feels weird typing in that market cap. And yet, it seems like the total addressable market (TAM) for cloud services has been completely underestimated. Azure grew +59% yoy in the last quarter off a huge base. Some crazy yoy numbers: revenue +14%, operating income +27%, and these numbers included a drag from FX translations. I think Microsoft is a lock to compound earnings at 15-20% over the next few years, and on track to return something like US$32bn each year to shareholders via buybacks and dividends. A much transformed company under stellar leadership, and now firing on all cylinders. Should probably be a larger holding, to be honest.</p>
        <p><b>ACM Research (US$690mn): </b>Supplier of wafer-cleaning equipment to the DRAM industry. Largest customers are SK Hynix and an undisclosed Chinese DRAM maker (I think Changxin Memory Technologies, or CXMT). Given the Chinese government's intention to build out its own memory industry, expect a bonanza of capex in this space. Revenues were basically flat from 2015 to 2017, then doubled in 2018, and grew another 40% in 2019, with earnings tripling. We've seen this story play out many times in the semiconductor space - where a niche player gains a toe-hold, delivers a quality product, then expands its footprint within its customer base. Pretty soon, it becomes industry standard. Best of all in the semi equipment space - most of the costs are R&D expense to engineers, so sales growth drops to bottom line and ROIC can potentially explode. Reminds me of Lam Research in the early innings. Very strong management quality, including ex-TSMC CTO on board and several ex-Intel executives. CEO David H. Wang is totally committed to the company, having founded it in 1998 and toiling away in obscurity for 20+ years. 18x P/E, but earnings could surprise to the upside. This investment ticks so many boxes that my instinctive reaction was to be highly skeptical: (1) bet on the jockey; (2) undiscovered small cap; (3) growth; (4) quality; (5) valuation; (6) structural trend. If they get to US$50mn in net income, will be a billion-dollar stock. Quite over-valued now after a spectacular start to 2020, I took the opportunity to trim this position. I started buying when it was a cute little US$250mn company, and now it's nearly tripled that, while earnings are probably going to move from US$20mn to US$30mn this year. Effectively, at these prices, you're paying up for like 3 years of growth. It'll probably get there, but returns aren't going to be that great going forward. Very much a source of funds!</p>
        <p><b>Amazon (US$906bn): </b>Amazon is no longer the no-brainer that it was at $360, but I reckon AWS could be worth US$500bn, and the retail side accounts for the rest of the valuation. Seeing some competition from the likes of Shopify, as the Internet space fragments into tribes, but continues to take share from the offline retailers. If this were a Chinese company, could spin some dog-and-pony story and get phantom valuation for its health and logistics arms. Ultimately, with a company this side, you are making an investment in management and company culture. It sounds weird to say this, but Amazon is no longer aggressively overvalued. By my reckoning, it trades at 25x FY22f P/E, if you normalize earnings. Clearly, they're going to undeclare earnings to reduce their tax liability, but this is a company that could declare mammoth profits whenever it wants to.</p>
        <p><b>Alphabet (US$1tn): </b>You probably don't need me to tell you what Google does, but I do want to make a note of the company going after OTAs like Expedia, Trivago and Tripadvisor in the last reported quarter. It's a sign that Google will do almost anything to hit its 20% earnings growth target, and there's very little anyone can do about it! By the way, Booking Holdings is worth consideration here. Management is totally undisciplined about capital management, but still has a few more levers to pull and some undermonetized properties, like Google Maps. I mean, if you believe in machine learning, how can you not own the company that has the most valuable data on user intentions?</p>
        <p><b>KKR (US$26bn): </b>In a low rate environment where hedge funds consistently underperform, more and more money is going to real estate, private equity and alternative investment managers. KKR shares a similar thesis to Blackstone, but it's cheaper at 15x P/E (or 6x if you exclude balance sheet investments!). AUM should keep growing at 18–20% type CAGR, which alone should drive fees, but there’s also another US$60bn in dry powder that hasn’t started earning fees. Many of the funds are very young in vintage, below 10 years old: 84% of the incentive fees derive from 28% of AUM. Now model this 5 years out, and decide how cheap it is. Realistically, this should be a US$60–80bn type of company in a couple of years.</p>
        <p><b>Vanguard Total Market Index ETF: </b>I have a lot of thoughts on the merits of holding a total market index as a cash proxy instead of cash... it's a lengthy subject that's worth a more in-depth discussion some other time.</p>
