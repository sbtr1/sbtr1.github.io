        <h3>about substrata</h3>
        <p>I've spent 10 years in various roles in the finance industry: 2 years as a quantitative analyst on Wall Street in FX and fixed income research, where I had a front-row seat to the 2008 financial crisis; 6 years as an equity research analyst at a boutique fund in Asia where I invested in the rise of China, and a year as a quantitative strategist at an investment firm where I continue to learn about alternative data.</p>
        <p><i>Why substrata?</i> A substratum is an underlying layer or foundation beneath the surface of the ground. In investing, what we perceive is often just the superficial layer (e.g. the asset price), but what we really want to invest in is the substratum (e.g. the operating business). The name is just a reminder not to get distracted and to focus on what's important. Or, as Kendrick Lamar might say, <i>"There's levels to it, you and I know... be humble."</i></p>
